      “My job is my passion. I love a good challenge, but I feel most at home
      designing residential spaces, houses, and buildings — from the initial
      concept all the way to detailed design. From the very beginning, my
      projects take shape as 3D models, as function and form are equally
      important to me. My mission is simple: to make every next project my best
      one yet.”

        With over 16 years of experience across a wide range of projects — from
        urban development and regeneration to architectural and interior design
        — she brings a project from the first concept to the final design.
      </p>
      <p>
        She has led teams of designers, architects, and engineers throughout the
        design phase and successfully managed construction teams all the way to
        project handover. Her expertise also includes preparing high-quality
        marketing materials tailored to each project’s unique vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        She holds a Master’s degree in Architecture, with a thesis focused on
        the urban redevelopment of a former industrial zone on an island in
        Varna, Bulgaria — including the architectural design of a remarkable
        mixed-use complex combining a hotel, offices, a conference center, and a
        shopping mall situated at the island’s peak. She has academic
        specialization in urban renewal and is a licensed architect with the
        Serbian Chamber of Engineers (license no. 300M12313).
